# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Atlas website and our mobile application.

<br>

### Information We Collect

New Atlas researcher accounts can be created in our closed beta program or can be added by request. Atlas collects the email and encrypted password for each researcher. You may request to remove the email address and password from your account. Email addresses are only used for logging in. We store procedure types, pain scores, and 6-digit unique IDs for each patients. Any personal information that is collected is linked to the 6-digit ID that only your research coordinator has access to. We do not send promotional emails.

### Technical basics

When notifications are enabled, we do not store any tokens in a serve; all notifications are served locally. Notifications will only be used for patients to know when to record a survey. A password is not required for users to log in. A 6 digit ID is all that is needed for users to start taking surveys. In order for the user to resume from where they are left off, the 6 digit ID and procedure type will be stored locally on the user's device. Users can clear data from the app's local storage and log out as necessary.

### iCloud

Atlas does not store any of your data in Apple’s iCloud service, such as login tokens, emails, or 6 digit IDs for your account(s); rather, only authorized emails and 6 digit IDs are stored in Google's Firebase database.

### Cloudflare

For performance and overload protection, we direct your traffic through Cloudflare (via the Unicorn Platform) before it reaches servers. They have access to some basic technical information to perform this role, such as your IP address. Please refer to Cloudflare’s and Unicorn Platform's privacy policy.

### Ads and Analytics

Atlas's app does not collect any statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, or user demographics. Atlas does not show any advertisements client-side and does not collect any personal data to tailor any features to users.

### Information Usage

The information that is sent to our database will be aggregated to a spreadsheet and generated for researchers to analyze (No names, only 6-digit IDs). We do not share personal information with outside parties, whatsoever. We also do not share anonymous, aggregated statistics with outside parties, such as user statistics. We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property. This service is not for profit, so there will be no transactions involving user assets/data and multiple parties.

### Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication between the app and the backend requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. All data included passwords are encrypted by Firebase. Data is encrypted in transit, and it is stored on encrypted disks on the servers. If you enable local persistence on the device, the on device data is not encrypted. Authorized administrators of the app can see all the data in the Firebase console.

### Accessing and Deleting Information

You may view your information or delete your account from the Atlas iOS app. The option to change data is coming soon. Deleted information is not kept as backups. Atlas may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

### Third-party Links and Content

Atlas uses links and content such as icons and services from third-party sites (Firebase, ResearchKit, FlatIcon, Icons8.com). These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

### California's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent. We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy or the beta program, you may email ucsf.atlasapp@gmail.com. Please note that account deletion should be done within the Atlas app, not via email requests, for security reasons.

### International Transfers of Information

Information is not processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

### Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.
